## Writing Style Guide

### Code Comments

When you finish a task, delete old comments and annotations that are no longer necessary (e.g., UPDATED or CORRECTED) to keep the code up to date. Leave only information that is useful even without context.
For example, comments such as "Forgetting this step will cause a bug" are worth keeping, but comments about the fact that a bug has been fixed are not necessary.

### Documentation

Avoid terms such as "sophisticated," which can come across as narcissistic. Documents should be neutral, not self-aggrandizing.
